;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides utilities for `haskell-mode' tests.

;;; Code:

(defun insert-lines (&rest lines)
  "Insert all LINES in current buffer."
  (let ((ls lines)
        (line ""))
    (while ls
      (setq line (car ls))
      (setq ls (cdr ls))
      (when ls
        (insert line)
        (insert "\n")))
    (insert line)))

(defmacro with-temp-switch-to-buffer (&rest body)
  "Create a temporary buffer and evalute BODY there.
Uses `switch-to-buffer' and evaluates BODY in temp buffer like `progn'.

Seems that `execute-kbd-macro' is not able to correctly execute
keybindings without this."
  (declare (indent 0) (debug t))
  (let ((temp-buffer (make-symbol "temp-buffer")))
    `(let ((,temp-buffer (generate-new-buffer " *temp*")))
       ;; FIXME: kill-buffer can change current-buffer in some odd cases.

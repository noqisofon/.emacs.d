2.0.9 (master):
* Do not activate Tuareg for .mll and .mly files.
* Toplevel prompt is readonly.
* Font-lock code completely rewritten (avoids several hangs).  New faces
  `tuareg-font-lock-module-face', `tuareg-font-lock-constructor-face',
  and `tuareg-font-lock-line-number-face'.
* Non-closed comment does not cause M-q to hang.
* New variables `caml-types-build-dirs' and `caml-types-annot-dir' for
  a more versatile specification of .annot files.  (Submitted back to
  caml-mode.)
* Fix toplevel highlighting of output and errors.
